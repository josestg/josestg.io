# Adapter

TODO...

## Functional Adapter

We can observe this pattern in the Go standard library `net/http`. But before diving into that, let's examine the code below to understand how this pattern works.

```go
// HealthHandler is a handler for health check.
type HealthHandler struct {
	log *slog.Logger
}

// NewHealthHandler creates a new health handler.
func NewHealthHandler(log *slog.Logger) *HealthHandler {
	return &HealthHandler{log: log}
}

// ServeHTTP implements http.Handler.
func (h *HealthHandler) ServeHTTP(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
	started := time.Now()
	l := h.log.With("method", r.Method, "uri", r.RequestURI)

	w.WriteHeader(http.StatusOK)
	if _, err := io.WriteString(w, "OK"); err != nil {
		l.Error("could not write response", "error", err)
	} else {
		l.Info("health check success", "latency", time.Since(started))
	}
}

// RegisterRoutes registers all routes to mux.
func RegisterRoutes(mux *http.ServeMux) {
	log := slog.New(slog.NewTextHandler(os.Stderr, &slog.HandlerOptions{}))
	slog.SetDefault(log)

	health := NewHealthHandler(log)
	mux.Handle("/api/v1/health", health)
}
```

The code above is straightforward. We have a simple health check handler registered at the path `/api/v1/health`, and for the sake of simplicity, we allow all methods. When a request is received by the handler, it logs request information and latency. As we can see, the handler is very simple, but we need to create a new type to satisfy the `http.Handler` interface. Fortunately, `http.ServeMux` also has a method that can accept a function instead of an `http.Handler` interface. After some refactoring, we have this:

```go
// HealthCheckHandler handles health check request.
func HealthCheckHandler(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
	started := time.Now()
	l := slog.Default().With("method", r.Method, "uri", r.RequestURI)

	w.WriteHeader(http.StatusOK)
	if _, err := io.WriteString(w, "OK"); err != nil {
		l.Error("could not write response", "error", err)
	} else {
		l.Info("health check success", "latency", time.Since(started))
	}
}

// RegisterRoutes registers all routes to mux.
func RegisterRoutes(mux *http.ServeMux) {
	log := slog.New(slog.NewTextHandler(os.Stderr, &slog.HandlerOptions{}))
	slog.SetDefault(log)

	mux.HandleFunc("/api/v1/health", HealthCheckHandler)
}
```

The `mux.HandleFunc` takes an ordinary function with the required signature `func(http.ResponseWriter, *http.Request)` and internally implements the `http.Handler` interface. But how does it work?

In Go, a function is a first-class citizen, meaning we can treat functions like any other value, including defining methods on function types. The concept of a functional adapter is an idea that allows an ordinary function to satisfy an interface without the need for an intermediate struct to wrap the function. Let's take a look at `http.HandlerFunc`, which is the functional adapter that converts an ordinary function with the signature `func(http.ResponseWriter, *http.Request)` into an `http.Handler`. To achieve this, the first step is to define a type with the same signature as the method to be implemented, which in our case is `http.Handler`.

```
type HandlerFunc func(http.ResponseWriter, *http.Request)
```

We can create a simple check to verify if the `HandlerFunc` signature matches that of `http.Handler.ServeHTTP` by using the following code:

```go
// quick check to verify if the HandlerFunc has the same signature as
// http.Handler.ServeHTTP.
var _ HandlerFunc = http.DefaultServeMux.ServeHTTP
```

The next step is to implement the `http.Handler` interface, which is our target interface.

```go
// ServeHTTP calls f(w, r).
func (f HandlerFunc) ServeHTTP(w ResponseWriter, r *Request) {
	f(w, r)
}
```

The implementation is very straightforward; it simply forwards the call to the receiver, which is the actual function. Now, let's use `mux.Handle` as before, and it will work.

```go

// The HandlerFunc type is an adapter to allow the use of
// ordinary functions as HTTP handlers. If f is a function
// with the appropriate signature, HandlerFunc(f) is a
// Handler that calls f.
type HandlerFunc func(http.ResponseWriter, *http.Request)

// quick check to verify if the HandlerFunc has the same signature as
// http.Handler.ServeHTTP.
var _ HandlerFunc = http.DefaultServeMux.ServeHTTP

// quick check to verify if the HandlerFunc implements http.Handler.
var _ http.Handler = HandlerFunc(nil)

// ServeHTTP calls f(w, r).
func (f HandlerFunc) ServeHTTP(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
	f(w, r)
}

// HealthCheckHandler handles health check request.
func HealthCheckHandler(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
	started := time.Now()
	l := slog.Default().With("method", r.Method, "uri", r.RequestURI)

	w.WriteHeader(http.StatusOK)
	if _, err := io.WriteString(w, "OK"); err != nil {
		l.Error("could not write response", "error", err)
	} else {
		l.Info("health check success", "latency", time.Since(started))
	}
}

// RegisterRoutes registers all routes to mux.
func RegisterRoutes(mux *http.ServeMux) {
	log := slog.New(slog.NewTextHandler(os.Stderr, &slog.HandlerOptions{}))
	slog.SetDefault(log)

	mux.Handle("/api/v1/health", HandlerFunc(HealthCheckHandler))
}
```

The magic lies in `HandlerFunc(HealthCheckHandler)`. This code essentially converts the function into a custom type, `HandlerFunc`. Since `HandlerFunc` implements the `http.Handler` interface, it is accepted.

Fortunately, we don't have to implement this ourselves. The `net/http` package already provides the `http.HandlerFunc` for us.

This pattern is very useful, especially for testing, as I and the Go Core Teams have found. For example, we can create an adapter for [io.Closer](https://cs.opensource.google/go/go/+/master:src/net/http/transport_test.go;l=3578-3580;drc=6760f20ef58a8d99ffe898b51d938577ab19c900) to mock close behavior, or for [io.Reader](https://cs.opensource.google/go/go/+/master:src/io/multi_test.go;l=244-249;drc=7c47c9773cc3847f8851a04753f7f008b2add3b1), [io.Writer](https://cs.opensource.google/go/go/+/master:src/net/http/requestwrite_test.go;l=848-850;drc=403e5f1cb174185a763745276e12156e8d70ba6a), and so on.

This blog is based on what I learned from reading the "[Go Slices: Usage and Internals](https://go.dev/blog/slices-intro)" blog post.

When I read that blog post, I got curious and wanted to create my own version of a slice in a low-level language like C++. I wanted to understand how slices work in Go on a deeper level. I also wanted to confirm something mentioned in the Go Documentation they say that: slices are always passed by value, but they don't copy all the data. Instead, they only pass a small piece of information called the [SliceHeader](https://pkg.go.dev/reflect#SliceHeader), which is just 24 bytes long. This understanding made me realize that both an empty slice and a slice with a million items have the same size, which is the size of the [SliceHeader](https://pkg.go.dev/reflect#SliceHeader).

This blog will be divided into three sections. The first section will discuss the implementation, followed by the complexity analysis, and finally, the conclusion. Let's start with the implementation.

## Implementation

The complete code for this implementation is available on my [GitHub](https://github.com/josestg) in [this repository](https://github.com/josestg/go-slice-in-cpp).

### Define a Slice Type

For the `Slice` struct, I will follow the same structure as the [SliceHeader](https://pkg.go.dev/reflect#SliceHeader) in Go. For simplicity, this `Slice` is only able to store integers.

```cpp
typedef struct {
  int *data; // For simplicity, we only support int slices.
  int len;
  int cap;
} Slice;
```


### Make Function

The `make` function creates a new `Slice` with a specified initial length and capacity. It achieves this by using `calloc` to allocate a contiguous memory block of the given size, which is initialized to the zero value. The `make` function also performs checks to ensure that the length is always less than the capacity, and that the capacity is at least 1. Furthermore, the `make` function returns the `Slice` as a value, not a pointer type.

```cpp
// Create a slice of length len and capacity cap.
Slice make(int len, int cap) {
  if (len > cap) {
    throw std::runtime_error("make: len > cap");
  }

  // make sure the capacity is at least 1 and the length is at least 0.
  len = std::max(len, 0);
  cap = std::max(cap, 1);

  // create a contiguous block of memory as the backing array for
  // storing the actual data.
  int *backing_array = (int *) calloc(cap, sizeof(int));
  if (backing_array == nullptr) {
    throw std::runtime_error("make: out of memory");
  }

  return {.data = backing_array, .len = len, .cap = cap};
}
```

### Setter and Getter

Since we don't use classes in C++, we cannot override the `[]` operator for setter and getter. However, we can define two simple functions as follows:

```cpp
// Set the value at given index.
void set_value(Slice &s, int index, int value) {
  if (index < 0 || index >= s.len) {
    throw std::out_of_range("set_value: index out of range");
  }
  // setting the value by using pointer arithmetic.
  *(s.data + index) = value;
}

// Get the value at given index.
int get_value(const Slice &s, int index) {
  if (index < 0 || index >= s.len) {
    throw std::out_of_range("get_value: index out of range");
  }
  // getting the value by using pointer arithmetic.
  return *(s.data + index);
}
```

For `set_value`, it takes a reference to a `Slice`, and for `get_value`, it takes a read-only reference to a `Slice`. I do this intentionally to observe the behavior of passing by reference and by value in the `append` function later on.

### Helper Functions for Debugging

The `to_string` function returns a string representation of the `Slice`. For example, a `Slice` containing the values 1 and 2 will return `"[1, 2]"`. The other function overrides the `<<` operator to print more detailed information about the `Slice`. For the same `Slice`, the output will look like this: `"Slice{ .len=2, .cap=4, .data=[1, 2] }"`.

```cpp
std::string to_string(const Slice &s) {
  std::stringstream stream;
  stream << "[";
  for (int i = 0; i < s.len; i++) {
    stream << get_value(s, i);
    if (i != s.len - 1) {
      stream << ", ";
    }
  }
  stream << "]";
  return stream.str();
}

std::ostream &operator<<(std::ostream &os, const Slice &s) {
  os << "Slice{"
        " .len="  << s.len <<
        " .cap="  << s.cap <<
        " .data=" << to_string(s)
     << " }";
  return os;
}
```

### The Append Function

The `Append` function takes a copy of the `Slice` or the `SliceHeader` in Go and checks if there is still room for a new element. If not, it will allocate a new larger backing array and copy all the data into the newly allocated backing array. According to [this documentation](https://github.com/golang/go/blob/master/src/runtime/slice.go#L270-L272), slice growth can be either $2x$ or $1.25x$. For simplicity, a new backing array will always grow to 2x the previous capacity.


We can use `calloc` here, but by using `realloc`, we don't need to deallocate the previous backing array.

```cpp
// Append a new element to the slice.
Slice append(Slice s, int v) {
  if (s.len == s.cap) {
    // grow the backing array by 2x or 1 if the capacity is 0.
    int new_cap = std::max(2 * s.cap, 1);
    // reallocate basically creates a new contiguous block of memory
    // with the new capacity and copies the data from the old block to
    // the new block.
    int *new_backing_array = (int *) realloc(s.data, new_cap * sizeof(int));
    if (new_backing_array == nullptr) {
      throw std::runtime_error("grow: out of memory");
    }
    // move the pointer to the new backing array.
    s.data = new_backing_array;
    // update the capacity.
    s.cap = new_cap;
  }
  s.len++;
  set_value(s, s.len - 1, v); // set the value at the end of the slice.
  return s;
}
```

Copying the data from the previous backing array to a new backing array when `s.len == s.cap` might seem like it has worse performance, but it actually takes constant time complexity, $O(1)$. I will explain the math later.

### Demo

To see how the slice works, let's run the code below:

```cpp
int main() {
  Slice s = make(0, 1);
  std::cout << "slice created: " << s << std::endl;
  std::cout << "size of slice: " << sizeof(s) << std::endl;

  int last_cap = s.cap;
  for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
    std::cout << "append value: " << i << std::endl;
    s = append(s, i);
    if (s.cap != last_cap) {
      std::cout << "slice capacity changed: " << s << std::endl;
      last_cap = s.cap;
    }
  }

  std::cout << "slice: " << s << std::endl;

  std::cout << "updating slice[0] to 100" << std::endl;
  set_value(s, 0, 100);

  std::cout << "slice after update: " << s << std::endl;
  std::cout << "size of slice: " << sizeof(s) << std::endl;
  free_slice(s);
  return 0;
}
```

**Output:**

```cpp
slice created: Slice{ .len=0 .cap=1 .data=[] }
size of slice: 16
append value: 0
append value: 1
slice capacity changed: Slice{ .len=2 .cap=2 .data=[0, 1] }
append value: 2
slice capacity changed: Slice{ .len=3 .cap=4 .data=[0, 1, 2] }
append value: 3
append value: 4
slice capacity changed: Slice{ .len=5 .cap=8 .data=[0, 1, 2, 3, 4] }
append value: 5
append value: 6
append value: 7
append value: 8
slice capacity changed: Slice{ .len=9 .cap=16 .data=[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8] }
append value: 9
slice: Slice{ .len=10 .cap=16 .data=[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9] }
updating slice[0] to 100
slice after update: Slice{ .len=10 .cap=16 .data=[100, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9] }
size of slice: 16
```

By tracing the output, we can observe a few things:

1. The size of the slice, whether it is empty or contains values, is always 16 bytes long, which is the same as the size of the `Slice` struct or the `SliceHeader` in Go.
2. The capacity will double in size based on the initial capacity, meaning that if we provide a larger capacity when creating the slice, we can reduce the frequency of the growing process.
3. When passing a `Slice` as a value, it copies the `Slice`, but the `Data` pointer always points to the backing array. This is why even if we modify the copied `Slice`, the other copies of the `Slice` will have the same effect. This behavior is also observed in Go.


## Analyzing Time Complexity for the Append Function

As we've seen in the previous section, the slice does not frequently double its capacity. For instance, when we start with an initial capacity of $1$ and add $10$ items to the slice, the capacity is doubled only four times, at lengths of $1, 2, 4,$ and $8$. As we add more items, the frequency of capacity doubling decreases. This makes amortized analysis the best approach to understand complexity, as it considers the average workload distribution across iterations.

To formalize this, let $L$ be the length of the `Slice`, and $C$ be its capacity. Let's assume that initially, $L=0$ and $C=1$. To add $N$ items, two cases can occur:
1. First, if there is still room, adding a new item will take $O(1)$.
2. Second, if there is no more room, the length is doubled, and the items are copied to the new backing array, taking $O(L)$ time for copying. In this case, the capacity of the new backing array will be $C=2L$.

To calculate the total number of times the backing array is copied, we need to determine how many times it grows. Since it grows by a factor of 2 each time, there will be $K$ copies.

Thus, the total number of copies is:

$$
    1 + 2 + 4 + \dots + 2^{K} = \sum_{i=0}^{K}{2^i}
$$

which can also be expressed as:

$$
    \sum_{i=0}^{K}{2^{K-i}} = 2^K + 2^{K-1} + \dots + 2^2 + 2^1 + 2^0
$$

As we can see, these are geometric sequences with a ratio $r < 1$. We can calculate $r$ as follows:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    r &= \frac{2^{K-1}}{2^K} \\
      &= \frac{1}{2} \left(\frac{2^K}{2^K}\right) \\
      &= \frac{1}{2}
\end{aligned}

$$

Since $r<1$, we can use the geometric partial sum formula to calculate the total number of copies:

$$
\begin{equation}
\sum_{i=0}^{K}{2^{K-i}} = \frac{a}{1-r}
\end{equation}
$$

where $a=2^K$. Thus:

$$
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
\sum_{i=0}^{K}{2^{K-i}} &= \frac{2^K}{1-\frac{1}{2}} \\
&= \frac{2^K}{\frac{1}{2}} \\
&= 2^{K+1} \\
&= 2(2^{K})
\end{split}
\end{equation}
$$

The total number of copies is $2(2^K)$. Since we know that $2^K \leq N$, we can conclude that:

$$
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
2^K &\leq N \\
\log_{2}{2^K} &\leq \log_{2}{N} \\
K &\leq \log_{2}{N}
\end{split}
\end{equation}
$$

Therefore, the total number of copies is:

$$
    \begin{equation}
    \begin{split}
    total &= 2(2^{\log_{2}{N}}) \\
    &= 2(N)
    \end{split}
    \end{equation}
$$

When there is no more room for new items, the total number of copies is equal to $2N$. Otherwise, adding $N$ items takes $O(1)$ for each item, resulting in a total runtime of $O(N)$. Therefore, the worst-case runtime is $O(2N) + O(N) = O(3N)$. Since we are working on amortized analysis, we need to calculate the average time complexity for adding $N$ items, which is equal to:

$$
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
amortized &= O(\frac{2N+N}{N}) \\
&= O(\frac{3N}{N}) \\
&= O(3) \\
&= O(1)
\end{split}
\end{equation}
$$

In conclusion, using the amortized analysis, we can prove that adding $N$ items into `Slice` is $O(1)$ or **Constant**.


## Conclusion

1. Passing a `Slice` by value in Go is cheap since it does not copy the data in the backing array. So passing `Slice` by reference in Go is not necessary
2. The size of the `Slice` does not depend on how many items are stored in the slice; instead, it will always be equal to the size of the `SliceHeader`.
3. Adding a new item to the slice takes $O(1)$.
4. Even though adding a new item is $O(1)$, initializing a `Slice` with a larger capacity also reduces the frequency of growing, which, from a Go perspective, reduces memory allocation.
